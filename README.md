!IMPORTANT! The project is not starting on the first launch! You need to launch it again in order to start. A problem occurs with one of the foreign keys when the app is started for the first time.

This is a project for managing courses. The application supports three types of users: Student, Teacher, and Admin.
Students and Teachers have separate registration pages.
The app is pre-configured with two seeded users: an Admin and a Teacher. Their credentials are stored in the appsettings.json file.

What different users can do:
Student - join courses, submit files to lessons, see statistic about course completion, submit quizzes.
Teacher - create courses, create lessons, create quizzes, remove users from course.
Admin - everything that the other 2 roles can do, also add roles to other users, enroll them into courses and manage the whole system.

There is no theme on the current layout. Basic css is used in the files for better readability.
